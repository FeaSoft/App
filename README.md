# FeaSoft - Finite element analysis software for solids
FeaSoft is an open-source software application for performing linear perturbation analyses on solids via the finite element method with built-in capabilities for visualizing and interacting with finite element models and results. These linear perturbation analyses consist of static, frequency, and buckle analyses. Several finite elements are implemented, which can be applied in plane stress, plane strain, axisymmetric, and general three-dimensional cases. Distinct loading conditions can be modelled via the application of concentrated nodal loads, distributed surface loads (namely, pressures and surface tractions), and inertia loads (namely, body forces and accelerations, e.g., due to gravity).

FeaSoft was validated by testing several examples against Abaqus (a commercially available finite element software).

The distribution includes a quick start guide (https://github.com/FeaSoft/Guide).

No installation is required, just unzip the files and run fs_app.exe.
